# Bidding-System-Project

This repository contains a Java bidding project that facilitates the process of creating and managing contracts and bids between contractors. The project consists of several Java source files that work together to simulate a bidding system.

## Files Included

- Bid.java: This file represents the Bid class, which encapsulates information about a bid made by a contractor for a specific contract. It includes details such as the bid amount, contractor information, and contract details.

- Contract.java: This file contains the Contract class, which defines the structure of a contract. It includes attributes like the contract ID, project description, start and end dates, and other relevant information.

- Contractor.java: This file defines the Contractor class, which represents a contractor participating in the bidding process. It includes details about the contractor, such as their name, contact information, and possibly their past bid history.

- Date.java: This file likely defines the Date class, which could be used to handle date-related operations within the project. It may include methods for parsing, formatting, and comparing dates.
